Welcome to the game “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”

The game consists in catching as many falling coins as you can. 

The coins are falling through different paths or colors of the rainbow. 

Each path from left to right corresponds to a button from your keyboard: ‘G’, ‘H’, ‘J’ or ‘K’, respectively.

Press each key when the coin reaches the pot at the bottom to catch that coin.

Catch 50 coins and you win the game, but if you miss catching 5 coins then it’s Game Over.

Click anywhere in the screen to start the game, and also to restart after losing or winning each game.

Good luck!!
